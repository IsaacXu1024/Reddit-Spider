# Reddit Spider

A crawler made using python module Scrapy to gather large quantities of comments from specified subreddits (in start_info/subreddit.txt). The file start_urls.txt is generated by running generate_start_urls_text.py. Upon running the spider, it will crawl the front page and all top pages of the subreddit to record all comments. The comments are filtered and uniquely identified, the urls are recorded to reduce the time in future runs. Removing the visited_urls file will allow the spider to revisit these comment sections for new comments. Old comments will not be recorded again so long as the comment_id file is unperturbed.
